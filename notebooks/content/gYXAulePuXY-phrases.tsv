0	Thank you and good afternoon.
1	It's great to be back in Chicago.
2	Um
3	And thanks for that kind introduction.
4	Austin
5	Um, so I'm, I'm looking forward to our conversation, my conversation, uh, with, uh, uh, Professor Rajan Rahu, but first I'll briefly discuss the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.
6	So at the Fed, we are always focused on the dual mandate goals that Congress has given us maximum employment and stable prices.
7	Despite heightened uncertainty and downside risks, the US economy is still in a solid position.
8	The labor market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has come down a great deal, but it's still running a bit above our 2% objective.
9	Turning briefly to the incoming data, we'll get the initial reading on 1st quarter GDP in a couple of weeks. The data we have in hand so far suggests that growth has slowed in the first quarter of this year from last year's solid pace. Despite strong motor vehicle sales, overall consumer spending appears to have grown modestly.
10	In addition, strong imports during the first quarter, reflecting it reflecting attempts by businesses to get ahead of potential tariffs are expected to weigh on GDP growth.
11	Surveys of households and businesses report a sharp decline in sentiment and elevated uncertainty about the outlook largely reflecting trade policy concerns.
12	Outside forecasts for the full year are coming down and for the most part point to continued slowing but still positive growth.
13	We are closely tracking incoming data as households and businesses continue to digest these developments.
14	In the labor market during the 1st 3 months of this year, non-farm payrolls grew by an average of 150,000 jobs per month.
15	While job growth has slowed relative to last year, the combination of low layoffs and lower labor force growth has kept the unemployment rate in a low and stable range.
16	Meanwhile, the ratio of job openings to unemployed job seekers has remained just above one near its pre-pandemic level.
17	Wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation.
18	Overall, the labor market appears to be in solid condition and broadly in balance and is not a significant source of inflationary pressure.
19	As for our price stability mandate, inflation has significantly eased from its pandemic highs of mid 2022 without the kind of painful rise in unemployment that has frequently accompanied efforts to bring down high inflation.
20	Progress on inflation continues at a gradual pace, and recent readings remain above our 2% objective. Estimates based on the most recent data from last week show that total headline PCE prices rose 2.3% over the 12 months ending in March, and that excluding the volatile food and energy categories core prices rose 2.6%.
21	Looking ahead, looking forward, the new administration is in the process of implementing a substantial policy changes in four distinct areas trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation.
22	These policies are still evolving and their effects on the economy remain highly uncertain.
23	As we learn more, we will continue to update our assessment.
24	The level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth.
25	Both survey and market-based measures of near term inflation expectations have moved up significantly, with survey participants pointing to tariffs.
26	Survey measures of longer term inflation expectations for the most part appear to remain well anchored as well. Market-based break evens continue to run close to 2%.
27	So as we gain a better understanding of the policy changes, we'll have a better sense of the implications for the economy and hence for monetary policy.
28	Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation.
29	The inflationary effects could also be more persistent.
30	Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and ultimately on keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored.
31	Our obligation is to keep longer term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem.
32	As we act to meet that obligation, we will balance our maximum employment and price stability mandates, keeping in mind that without price stability we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market conditions that benefit all Americans.
33	We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual mandate goals are intention. If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.
34	As that great Chicagoan Ferris Bueller once noted.
35	Life moves pretty fast.
36	For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.
37	We continue to analyze the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. We understand that elevated levels of unemployment or inflation can be damaging and painful for communities, families, and businesses.
38	We will continue to do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you, and I look forward to our discussion.
45	Well, um, first of all, thank you for for being here today. It's, it's a pleasure to be here with you. Actually, the speech, the appearance I did here was my very first appearance as chair 7.5 years ago, so it's great to be back and I would agree with you that it's been an eventful 7 years.
46	Putting it, putting it mildly, I keep waiting for the three months of calm, you know, that.
47	Never comes, but to your question, um, I guess to set the stage, let's look back at 2024. 2024 was a year where the economy grew 2.4%. Unemployment remained in the low fours, close to mainstream estimates of maximum employment, and inflation came down and was running at the end of the year around 2.5%. That's the economy that we had, and I, I won't decide how to characterize that, but that was, that's that's where things were.
48	Where we are now again to your question is the administration is, as I mentioned in my remarks, is implementing significant policy changes and particularly trade now is the focus and the effects of that are likely to move us away from our our goals. So um unemployment is likely to go up as the economy slows in all likelihood and inflation is likely to go up as tariffs find their way and some part of those tariffs come to the.
49	Come to be paid by the by the by the public, so that's the strong likelihood and you know my hope is that we'll we'll we'll get through this and get back what we're always going to be aiming for maximum employment and price stability. That's what we do. I do think we'll be moving away from those goals probably for the balance of this year and then or at least not making any progress, and then we'll resume that progress as we can.
52	So in in a kind of a simple starting point is a one tariff comes in that gets passed along in prices and raises inflation, but it's just a one-time thing so the price level goes up and that's it.
53	But that's and that can happen in some circumstances, but it depends on a number of things which we don't know yet, and I would point to a couple of them or 3 of them actually. One is just the size of the effects and as I mentioned, the um the tariffs are are larger than than forecasters had expected, certainly larger than we expected even in our upside case we looked at a range of cases, so that's one. The second one is how long does it take for.
54	The tariffs to have their effects on inflation to the extent it takes longer and longer that that that raises the risks that the public will begin to experience higher inflation. They'll come to expect it and companies will come to expect it. So that risks higher inflation. And the third is just what I mentioned in my speech, which is my remarks, which is got to keep inflation expectations well anchored. So if we have those, those three things under control.
55	That that's what it will take and indeed our role is to make sure that a one that this this will be a one time increase in prices and not something that turns into an ongoing inflation process that's that's a big part of our job.
60	I actually had dinner at the Chicago Fed last night and with a number of uh directors of uh various parts of the Chicago Fed, and many of them are, uh, CEOs of significant companies and, and they, um, this uncertainty that they're feeling and, and the issue with imported components to their products is, is just a huge issue.
61	But with um
62	You if you look back at the at the pandemic, if you remember there was a shortage shortage of semiconductors, and that led to a shortage of cars at a time of extremely high car demand and it was a prolonged shortage because production couldn't keep up and that led to an extended one of the things that led to an extended period of inflation. So when you think about supply disruptions, that is the kind of thing that can be that can take time to resolve and it can lead.
63	Uh, what would have been a one time inflation shock to be extended perhaps more persistent, and we would worry about that. In this case, you can look at the car companies which their supply chains are likely seem to be on track to be disrupted significantly, and you would worry that that process will take some years and that the inflationary process might be extended. So these are all all of this is highly uncertain. We're just we're thinking now really before the tariffs have their effects.
64	how they might affect the economy and that's, that's why we're we're we're waiting really to see what the policies ultimately are and then we can make a better assessment of what the economic effects will be.
67	So what part of why growth was so strong in the last couple of years was just very high levels of immigration and, and those people went to work. The, the economy hired them, you know, there, there was a lot of demand that we're still working off the labor shortage. What's happened since, um, the prior administration changed their policy, as you mentioned, uh, immigration has fallen very sharply and therefore work work the growth of workers has really stopped. It's really stagnant, but at the same time, demand has also fallen.
68	And so it demand for workers, so payroll job creation has also fallen, and they've kind of fallen in tandem, which is why the unemployment rate has been pretty stable for about a year. So, uh, in a way demand and, and coincidentally perhaps to some extent, uh, demand and supply for workers has fallen in terms of, so in terms of the effect on the labor market, um, right now we're we're still at full employment.
69	Uh, and, um, labor force participation is still strong. wages have moved back down to levels that are that are now pretty sustainable, given an assumption about productivity. So the labor markets in a really good place. Longer term, you know, the, uh, the effects of immigration are not thought to matter much for inflation. The effects on demand and supply will more or less, uh, cancel each other out, so we wouldn't expect there to be a big impact on inflation.
73	So it's,
74	it's too soon to say, but what I can say is, um, of course the people being laid off in government, this is highly significant to them. We don't know how big that's gonna be, um, right now it's not big enough to affect a workforce of 170 million people materially.
75	Um, in terms of, uh, the, of the cutbacks in funding and for science and things like that, um, we do see in areas in particularly in cities that have a lot of universities and research hospitals and research institutions we're really hearing significant, uh, layoffs and, you know, significant impacts on, on employment. I don't know how much that will total up to.
76	And of course, in addition, cutting back on scientific research may have implications for economic growth for productivity, for health, for all kinds of things, but those are very difficult to estimate in real time.
78	Right, so, um
79	Most of the time when the economy is weak, inflation is low and unemployment is high, and both of those call for lower interest rates to support activity and vice versa. So most of the time the two goals are not intention and they're not really intention now. The labor market is still strong, but the, you know, the shock that we're experiencing, the impulses we're seeing, feeling are for higher unemployment and higher inflation and.
80	You know, our, our tool only does one of those two things at the same time so it's a difficult place for central banks, you know, to be in, uh, in terms of what to do and so we, you know, the best we can do is we actually have a little provision in our, in our consensus statement which is the thing that.
81	We vote on to embody how we approach these questions. What we say is we will look at how far each of the two, how far the economy is from each of those two goals, and then we'll ask, uh, might there be different paces at which they would approach those goals. We'll look at those things and think about them and we'll make what will no doubt be a very difficult judgment again we're not, we're not experiencing that now, but we could well be in that situation, as I mentioned in my remarks.
85	Um
86	It's so let me just, uh, agree that we're what comes back very strongly and you'll you'll you'll everyone will understand this uh these are very fundamental changes in, you know, long held in some cases policies in the United States and there's not any real experience. I mean, uh, uh, the, the Smoot Hawley tariffs were actually not this large and they were 95 years ago, so there isn't a modern experience of how to think about this.
87	And businesses and households are are saying in surveys that they, they're experiencing incredibly high uncertainty. There's a lot of research, some of it from the Fed, showing that that does lead uh to businesses and households stepping back from decisions, which of course makes makes common sense, um, and you know you hope that that's something that you go through a phase and then you then you know what the things become more certain.
88	And and therefore, uh, you know, people can resume normal economic activities given their understanding of what is the new normal. I mean your question really is what if the if the uncertainty remains high. I think that's a difficult environment. I think, you know, I think people's expected rates of return would have to be higher. I think um people would be, it would that would weigh on to me investment.
89	Just in general, if, if, if the United States were to become jurisdiction where risks are just structurally higher going forward, that would, that would make us less less attractive as a jurisdiction. I don't, we don't, we don't know that at this point, but I think that would be the effect.
93	I'm going to say no with an explanation.
94	So what I think is going on in markets is
95	Markets are processing.
96	Uh, what's going on and you know it, it's really the policies, particularly the trade policy.
97	And really the question is where is that going to come in, where's that gonna land, and we don't know that yet. And until we know that you can't really make informed assessments that would still be highly uncertain once you know what the policies are, it will still be highly uncertain what the economic effects will be so markets are struggling with a lot of uncertainty and that means volatility. But having said that.
98	Markets are functioning, you know, conditional on being in such a challenging situation. Markets are doing what they're supposed to do. They're, they're orderly and they're functioning just about as you would expect them to function.
100	So I, I would just say the same thing. I, I, I think it's very hard to know in real time. I've had a lot of experience with, with significant moves, for example, in the bond market where there's a narrative that people land on, and then two months later you look back and go that was completely wrong. So I think it's very premature to say exactly what's going on. Clearly there's some delevering going on among hedge funds in lever trades and things like that.
101	It's also again it's the market's processing historically unique developments and with with great uncertainty and I think you'll see you'll probably see continued volatility but I I I wouldn't, I don't, I wouldn't um try to be definitive about exactly what's causing that. I would just say markets are orderly and and they're functioning kind of as you would expect them to in this time of high uncertainty.
103	Big overseas dollar funding markets and in fact those are those are overseas markets where for example a European or Asian institution is buying.
104	An asset-backed security that is backed by loans to American consumers. So in effect, these are loans to American consumers, and we support that. We want to make sure that dollars are available. They need dollar funding to hold those dollar assets. So the way it works is when needed, we lend to the central bank in dollars and they pay us back in dollars. They then pay in in their currency. They lend on lend on in dollars and so we take no credit risk or anything like that and it supports.
105	Dollar funding markets dollar funding markets are very sensitive during times of crisis, and it's very helpful. The reason we do it is it's really good for US consumers, so we'll continue to do that just as part of the dollar being a reserve currency, the reserve currency, most important, and we will do that.
108	So
109	the US is on US federal debt is on an unsustainable path. It's not at an unsustainable level and no one really knows how much further we can go. Other countries over time have gone much farther, but.
110	We're now, um, you know, we're running very large deficits at full employment and uh this is a situation that we we very much need to address. Sooner or later we'll have to and and sooner is better than later in terms of if if I can say from my time working on these issues, it's not the Fed's issue, but if you look at a pie chart of of federal spending, the biggest parts and the parts that are growing are Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and now interest payments.
111	Um, and so that's really where, where the work has to be, has to be done, and those, those are issues that can only be touched on a bipartisan basis, you know, neither party can figure out what to do without both parties being at the table, so that's that's critical. All of this domestic discretionary spending, which is essentially where 100% of the conversation is.
112	Is small as a percentage of of federal spending and is declining as a it's already declining as as a percentage of federal spending so when people are focusing on cutting the domestic spending, they're not actually working on the problem. Domestic discretionary spending is already going down. I just, I like to make that point because so much of the dialogue that the politicians offer is about domestic discretionary spending, which is not the issue.
116	I think our our banking system is well capitalized with liquidity and is, is, uh, quite resilient right now to the kinds of shocks that it may face. I, I do believe that.
117	In terms of the commercial real estate, there are, um, and this has been the case really we've been working on this for 4 or 5 years now. There are some banks, it's mostly medium and small sized banks who have elevated concentrations of commercial real estate, some of it troubled, and we've been working to make sure that those banks have a plan, have capital.
118	And can absorb the losses that they're doing so and that's been that's been going on for some time the very largest banks don't tend to have high concentrations, so this is a problem that we have known would take years to work through, but we're really well into the process of working through it in terms of non-bank, the nonbank financial sector.
119	It's grown enormously. The provision of credit by nonbanks has grown just really fast. Most of it has been funded though with a private equity like structure where where it's limited partners who are signed up for 10 years to a to a general partner to invest that money. They're not depositors who can run, you know, your, your money is committed and that's so that funding model is, is kind of run proof.
120	That's, that isn't, uh, some law of nature though. So when you do start to see shorter term funding creeping in to your point though, Ragu, the um, the, the this very fast growing and now quite large private credit part of the part of the economy has not really been through a significant credit event or significant it's really grown since the pandemic and so just for that reason and for how fast it's growing we we have a close eye on it. It doesn't have the same kind of prudential regulation though that.
121	Uh, that the banking system has, so we're watching it carefully and you know, as I mentioned, it's, it's a more stable funding source to extend its institutional investors signed up for a long period, but we're watching
122	carefully,
125	The the Fed view and my view is that we should proceed to complete the Basel 3, accord and, and, uh, we would have to do that and we look forward to doing that with the in conjunction with the FDIC and the OCC but our view is, and I think that the bank's view as well is we should complete that you need international minimum standards that's that's kind of a common good and you know we're not bound by them, uh, really, uh.
126	Nothing. The United States has plenty of input into what what what does accords contain so our view is strongly that we should complete those and we could do it, I think, relatively quickly. We're, we're not so very far away from uh from what would be a good, I think, uh, outcome.
128	You know, so we went through a wave of um failures and fraud and things like that where the headlines for a couple of years and um I think what you what you see now is um.
129	And during that period, by the way, we were trying to work, we worked with Congress to try to get a a framework, a legal framework for stable coins which would have been a nice place to start. We were not successful. I think that the climate is changing and you're, you're moving into sort of more mainstreaming of of uh.
130	Of that whole sector, so Congress is again looking at at both both the Senate and the House are looking at a framework, a legal framework for stablecoins, you know, depending on what's in it, that's a good idea we need that there isn't one now and stablecoins are a product that a digital product that could actually have fairly wide appeal and should contain consumer protections of of the typical sorts and transparency and that's what the Senate and the House are working on so that's a positive thing. I also think some of the um.
131	You know, we took a pretty conservative and other other bank regulators took an even more conservative perspective on on on the guidance and rules we imposed on banks. I think there'll be some loosening of that, and I think we'll try to do it in a way that preserves safety and soundness, but that, you know, permits and fosters appropriate appropriate innovation, and but that that does so in a way that again doesn't doesn't put consumers at risk in ways they don't understand or or make banks less safe and sound.
136	First of all, you're, I think you're right, and I think the public is right. What you know, when, when we say inflation is back down to 2%, 2.5%, uh, and we think that's a good thing. It is a good thing, but if you're, you know, if you're paying 20% more than you were paying in in 2021.
137	That doesn't help you much. You're still paying a lot more than you used to be paying for the necessities of life, so it's just another way of saying people hate inflation and.
138	It's easy to understand why, you know, what we all we can really control is, uh, a world in which the in the world we we were living in prices don't go down in the aggregate except in extreme times that we don't want a court, so I don't think we could, we couldn't have a framework where we're gonna bring prices down by 10% or something that that's not something we'll be looking at, you know, we're, we're essentially looking at the best way to foster 2% inflation over time.
139	And you know the things we did back in uh the changes we made in 2020 were were really innovations around what to do when you're stuck near zero. Now we're well above zero and it, you know, it may be that we, we still need to have in our framework a way to deal with that, but perhaps the, the main case is not one where you're dealing with the effect of lower bound, and that would be a framework that looks a lot more like the one that we had before 2020.
143	So in, in the beginning it's, it almost, it's typically we're using it for financial market function that's that that was the case with the uh with the global financial crisis and with the pandemic.
144	Um, and we, you know, we did, we did try to explain ourselves through the pandemic, uh, and our explanations did change, but I think it's fair, it's fair to say we might have done a better job of, uh, of being clear about why we were doing and that's, that's something that we're, we're aware of and looking at.
148	So like everyone who's been exposed to what it's capable of, it's just, it's beyond, um, I mean, I started about thinking about it as like a, a better version of Google, but it's not, it's like a better version of a person, you know.
149	Uh, I mean, it can do amazing things and so the question is it all through the 250 years of technological innovation.
150	Technology evolves and people worry that it's going to replace human labor and people will be unemployed and that hasn't been the case or it may be the case in the short run, but in the long run what it's done is raise human productivity and therefore living standards. So is this gonna be the case where it eliminates more jobs than it than it than it creates and we just don't know uh I mean you come back in 20 years will will it be the case that just.
151	People are much more productive in their work because of AI or will it be the case that AI has just replaced a lot of people, and I, I think it's very hard to, to say, but it, it truly is remarkable in what it's capable of and it's, um, you know, we, we just, we had a, uh, we had a demonstration by a a warden professor recently and he was, he you speak to it like it's a person and it kind of responds like a person and and the things that it can do are are are really amazing, uh.
152	So, and by the way, this is early days, you know, they're talking about even the next couple of years will bring more dramatic breakthroughs. So I think it's it's one of the two or three things most likely to bring dramatic change to the economy all around the world in the next 20 years, and I'd say very hard to see how it shakes out.
157	So I, I would agree. I think it's, I think it's the best job in government. I would agree and I, I really do enjoy it. Yes, uh, I love the job. It's a great honor to serve. It's quite humbling because, you know, everybody makes mistakes. It's just the the economy is just not very predictable, um, so all of that is true and I you know I do what everybody expects me to do. I read, we do a little more reading though as part of our.
158	Uh, daily, my colleagues and I do part of our daily regime than than a typical executive would do in terms of being a god, I would say that we are, we are blessed with a large number of uh amply compensated critics who.
159	Who would kind of tend to undercut that so we don't, we don't feel like a god.
162	So you know I'd say start with labor, you know, there there's more labor market data and more and better reliable labor market data than probably anywhere else and uh it's just a lot of data and you know it's, it's new jobs, it's payroll, it's it's uh wages, it's participation.
163	You can break all of those down in different categories. It's, it's a million different things. So there's a lot of labor market data. It's a great field if you're going into economics because there's just so much to do. So and then we look at the inflation data also, I, you know, I keep track of, of global developments pretty carefully and I talk to my global counterparts pretty regularly just to stay aware of what's going on.
164	Um, financial markets are really important and you know you can, and, and lately something that's that we've we're paying close attention to as you would expect what's going on around the world in currency markets and fixed income markets and equity markets, all of that for me though my my background.
165	Was more in the private sector and and you know as an investor and for for a significant part of my career and I, I have to talk to outsiders about what they're seeing and what they're dealing with for it to really kind of fit together for me I I you know I can look at only so much data and you know I, I, but to really get the story and the narrative it's, it's more talking to outsiders and and you know anecdotal data does help things kind of fit together for me I would say.
169	so our, our independence is a matter of law. um, Congress has in, in our statute we're not removable except for cause. We serve very long terms, seemingly endless terms.
170	Um, so it's, it will protect protected in the law, so you know Congress could change that law, but there's, I don't think there's any danger of that, uh, Fed independence has pretty broad support, uh, across both political parties and in, in, um, both sides of the hill. So I think that's not a problem. Um, there's a Supreme Court case people will have read probably in today's journal that at which the Supreme Court may decide whether independent agencies generally.
171	Whether they're authorizing laws can contain a provision that prevents the president from firing members of a commission.
172	On other than for cause, and that's, that's a, that's a case that people are talking about a lot. I don't think that that decision will apply to the Fed, but I don't know but it's it's a situation that we're monitoring carefully generally speaking.
173	Fed independence is very widely understood and supported in Washington in Congress where it really matters and uh you know the point is we can make our decisions and we will only make our decisions based on our best thinking, based on our best analysis of the data about what what is the way to serve our to achieve our dual mandate goals as we can to best serve the American people. That's the only thing we're ever gonna do. We're never gonna be influenced by any political pressure.
174	People can say whatever they want, that's fine that's not a problem, but we will do what we do, uh, strictly without consideration of political or any other extraneous factors.
177	You know, I, I played my, uh, one of my guitars. I, uh, I do Zoom calls with my, uh, my kids and my grandkids, and I, uh, go to the gym a lot too just to stay in shape.
